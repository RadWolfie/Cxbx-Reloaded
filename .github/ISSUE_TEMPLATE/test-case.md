Remember, the GitHub Issue Tracker is not the place to ask for support or to submit game compatibility https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/game-compatibility/blob/master/README.md reports.
You must use our forum on Discord https://discord.gg/26Xjx23 for that.
Otherwise, for any test case popups or from the log, please check our issue list first before create a new ticket for test case you found.
